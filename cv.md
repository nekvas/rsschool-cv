- About myself:

I have a higher education - construction. I worked as an engineer in construction, but this work did not bring me pleasure.

I really enjoy learning new things for myself. The strong side of my character is if you start with something, then you need to figure it out with all your might. **I will try very hard. ** Probably a lot depends on me. Maybe it won't be such a difficult path. But for this you need to study a lot.
